# Numerical-simulation-for-Graphene-Field-Effect-Transistors-GFETs-
Numerical simulation in MATLAB for a physical model of GFETs developed by PhD Pedro Feijoo (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid). The goal is to study static saturation points and possibly extend the model to transient models for frequency analysis.
