# Numerical-simulation-for-Graphene-Field-Effect-Transistors-GFETs-
Numerical simulation in MATLAB for a physical model of GFETs developed by PhD Pedro Feijoo (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid). The goal is to study static saturation points and possibly extend the model to transient models for frequency analysis. 

TFG__tarea3_v3.m has the simulation code and the Tarea3_Graficos.m has the graphics code for a specific voltage input.

Mathematical and construction explained in PDF file.
